    "Please read these terms of service (“Terms of Service”) and the Zoom Services Description (collectively, this “Agreement”) carefully. This Agreement is between you and Zoom Video Communications, Inc. and its affiliates (“Zoom,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and governs your access to and use of our Services and Software, unless you and Zoom have entered into a written Master Subscription Agreement (MSA), in which case such MSA will govern your access to and use of the Services and Software and not these Terms of Service. You may enter into this Agreement on behalf of yourself or on behalf of a legal entity. If you enter into this Agreement on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are a duly authorized representative with the authority to bind that legal entity to this Agreement. All references to “you” and “your” in this Agreement mean the person accepting this Agreement as an individual or the legal entity for which the representative is acting. Capitalized terms in this Agreement will have definitions as set forth in the applicable section where they are defined, in the Zoom Services Description, or in Section 34 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may provide the Services and Software through Zoom Video Communications, Inc., our affiliate(s), or both. You may only use the Services and Software in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, AS IT PROVIDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS: (i) in Section 27, that you and Zoom will arbitrate certain claims instead of going to court and that you will not bring class-action claims against Zoom; (ii) in Sections 12 and 14, that certain terms and conditions apply with respect to recurring subscription Charges and automatic renewals; (iii) in Section 15, that Zoom may make modifications, deletions, and additions to these Terms of Service and our Service Description; and (iv) in Section 26, that you release Zoom from, and waive your right to recover from Zoom, certain damages. You acknowledge that you will only create an account or otherwise use the Services and Software if you agree to be legally bound by all terms and conditions herein. Your acceptance of this Agreement creates a legally binding contract between you and Zoom.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACCOUNT INFORMATION; SHARING \n",
    "1.1 Registration; Username and Passwords. You may be required to provide information about yourself to register for and to access or use the Services and Software. You represent and warrant that any such information, including Customer Data, is and will remain accurate and complete, and that Zoom has no liability whatsoever for errors and omissions in your Customer Data. You may also be asked to choose a username and password to access or use the Services and Software. We may reject, or require that you change, any such username or password, in our sole discretion. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the security of your username and password, and you agree not to disclose or make your username or password accessible to any third party.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Prohibition on Sharing. You may not share an account, Host rights, or any other user rights with any other individual, unless otherwise expressly pre-approved by Zoom in writing.

Your right to use or access the Services and Software is personal to you and not assignable or transferable. You may not assign or transfer any account, Host rights, or any other user rights with any other individual, except upon (i) an individual termination of employment or relationship with their employer, as applicable, or (ii) Zoom’s prior express written approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDERING SERVICES\n",
    "2.1 Order Form. You may order the Services through an online registration or order form approved and authorized by Zoom (each an “Order Form”). Any order for the Services made pursuant to an Order Form is subject to the terms of this Agreement. An Order Form may contain additional or different terms, conditions, and information regarding the Services you are ordering as authorized and agreed to by Zoom. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Order Form authorized and agreed to by Zoom, the applicable Order Form controls and governs over this Agreement, to the extent necessary to resolve the particular conflict or inconsistency only. Zoom will provide the Services set forth in your Order Form and standard updates to the Services that we make generally available at no additional cost to similarly situated customers in the same geographic region during the applicable Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term. Zoom may, in its sole discretion, (i) discontinue the Services, or (ii) modify the features or functionality of the Services or Software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Minimum Commitment. You will maintain your minimum quantity of the Services set forth on your Order Form for the duration of the applicable Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term. Any timely and contractually available modification to the Services set forth on your Order Form will be effective only upon the commencement of your next Renewal Term, unless you request an increase in the Services, which will take effect as indicated in the applicable Order Form.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Outstanding Balance; Late Payment. Without limiting our rights in this Agreement, including Sections 12.7 and 14.3, you acknowledge that Zoom is not required to provide any new Services set forth in an Order Form until all outstanding balances due and owing for existing Services are paid in full.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACCESS AND USE; SOFTWARE LICENSE\n",
    "3.1 Access and Use; Software License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may access and use, during the Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term, the Services as set forth on each applicable Order Form. If access to or use of any portion of the Services requires or allows for you to download, use, or install Zoom software (“Software”), Zoom grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and royalty-free license to use the Software in object code format on a compatible device for your internal use only, solely to access and use the Services during the applicable Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term. You acknowledge and agree that your access to and use of the Services and Software under this Section 3.1 (and as otherwise provided in this Agreement) is revocable in Zoom’s sole discretion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Documentation License. Subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, Zoom grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and royalty-free license for you to use Zoom-provided product and services documentation (“Documentation”) solely for your internal business purposes in connection with use of the Services or Software during the applicable Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Ownership. You acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Services are provided to you on a subscription basis, and the Software and Documentation is provided to you under a limited license, and neither has been sold to you. You also acknowledge that you have neither obtained nor will obtain any ownership or other right, title, or interest in or to the Services, Software, or Documentation or any Proprietary Rights relating thereto. Any copies of Software will remain the exclusive property of Zoom. The Software may include code that is licensed to you under third party license agreements, including open source software made available or provided with the Software. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Zoom owns all right, title, and interest in and to all upgrades, enhancements, new releases, changes, and modifications to the Services or Software, together with all ideas, architecture, algorithms, models, processes, techniques, user interfaces, database design and architecture, and “know-how” embodying the Services and Software. Under no circumstances will you be deemed to receive, have, or be granted title to all or any portion of the Services, Software, or Documentation, title to which at all times vests exclusively in Zoom. None of the Services, Software, or Documentation, or any component thereof, is or shall be deemed to be a “work made for hire,” as that term is defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESPONSIBILITY FOR USE AND END USERS\n",
    "4.1 Use of the Services; End User Responsibility. You will, and you will cause your End Users to, abide by and ensure compliance with, all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Use of the Services is void where prohibited. You are responsible for your and your End Users’ access to and use of the Services and Software. You are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including ensuring that all End Users will comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any applicable Zoom policies. You acknowledge that you remain liable for the acts and omissions of any third party that you allow, enable, or otherwise provide access to the Services or Software, whether or not such access was expressly permitted by Zoom.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Violations by End Users or Third Parties. Zoom assumes no responsibility or liability for violations of this Agreement by End Users or any other third party that you allow, direct, or enable to access the Services or Software.

    "\n",
    "4.3 Liability for Content and Data. Under no circumstances will Zoom be liable in any way for any data or other content viewed while using the Services, including any errors or omissions in any such data or other content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of, access to, or denial of access to any data or other content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.4 Investigation of Use. Zoom may investigate any complaints and violations that come to our attention and may take any action, in its sole discretion, including issuing warnings, suspending or disconnecting the Services or Software, removing the applicable data or other content, terminating accounts or End User profiles, or taking other reasonable actions in its sole discretion.\n",
    "\n",
    "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS; CHANGES\n",
    "Your use of the Services and Software requires one or more compatible devices, Internet access, and certain third-party software, and you may be required to obtain updates or upgrades from time to time for Software or third-party software, which may result in additional costs to you. Because use of the Services and Software involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to access and use the Services and Software may be affected by the performance of the foregoing. High-speed Internet access is recommended. You are solely responsible for any fees that may apply to your access to or use of the Services and Software, including fees for hardware, software, Internet access, or text messages.

    "DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n",
    "You agree to resolve certain disputes with Zoom through binding arbitration (“Arbitration Agreement”). Arbitration means that an arbitrator, and not a judge or a jury, will decide the dispute. The parties expressly waive the right to bring or participate in any kind of class, collective, or mass action, private attorney general action, or any other representative action. This Arbitration Agreement supersedes all prior versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.1 Covered Disputes. You and Zoom agree that any dispute or claim between you and Zoom arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services (a “Dispute”), including any related software, hardware, integrations, advertising or marketing communications, your account, or any aspects of your relationship or transactions with Zoom, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, a Dispute will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS HAVE BEEN FILED, OR MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD AFFECT YOU. YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD AFFECT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THOSE ACTIONS.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.2 Exceptions to Arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims brought by either you or Zoom: (i) small claims court actions, if the requirements of the court are met and the claims are only on an individual basis; and (ii) claims pertaining to intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.3 Informal Dispute Resolution First. We want to address any Disputes without needing arbitration. If you have a Dispute with Zoom, prior to initiating arbitration, you agree to mail an individualized request (“Pre-Arbitration Demand”) to ATTN: Litigation Department, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., 55 Almaden Blvd., San Jose, CA 95113 so that we can work together to resolve the Dispute. A Pre-Arbitration Demand is only valid when it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all. The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address associated with your account; (ii) the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any; (iii) a description of your Dispute; and (iv) your signature. Likewise, if Zoom has a Dispute with you, Zoom will send an email with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address associated with your Zoom account. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) calendar days of when either you or Zoom submitted a Pre-Arbitration Demand, an arbitration can be brought. If you or Zoom have a Dispute involving claims under the exception to arbitration in Section 27.2(2), then this Section 27.3 does not apply to such Dispute. You agree that compliance with this Section 27.3 is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.4 Arbitration Procedure. If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process set out in Section 27.3, either you or Zoom wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must serve the other party with a demand for arbitration. Any demand for arbitration by you shall be sent to the Zoom Litigation Department address in Section 27.3. Zoom will send any arbitration demand to the email address associated with your Zoom account or to your counsel, if any. You and Zoom agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs this Arbitration Agreement. If the FAA cannot apply for whatever reason, then the state laws governing arbitration procedures where you reside apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The applicable arbitration provider depends on where you live. If you are a California resident, the arbitration shall be administered by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) under its Arbitration Rules, available at https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules. If you are not a California resident, the arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms. This Agreement will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules. If the applicable arbitration provider is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. To the extent there is a dispute over which arbitration provider has jurisdiction, a NAM arbitrator shall be appointed to resolve that dispute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arbitration hearings will take place through videoconferencing by default, unless you and Zoom agree upon another location in writing. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and recoverable costs. Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction. An arbitration award shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve all threshold arbitrability issues, including whether this Agreement is applicable, unconscionable, or enforceable, as well as any defense to arbitration. However, a court has exclusive authority to rule on the Mass Action Waiver in Section 27.6, including any claim that the section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a request to proceed in small claims court (see Section 27.2(1)), is made after an arbitration has been initiated, but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. If you or Zoom challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this Arbitration Agreement as to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.5 Jury Trial Waiver. You and Zoom hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. You and Zoom are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 27.2 above. Court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.6 Mass Action Waiver. You and Zoom agree that, except as specified in Section 27.7 below, each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis, and the parties hereby waive all rights to have any Dispute be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section 27.6 are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Zoom agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and shall be pursued in the state or federal courts located in San Jose, California. This subsection does not prevent you or Zoom from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.7 Bellwether Arbitrations. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Zoom agree that if there are fifty (50) or more individual arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature brought against either party by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations within a one hundred and eighty (180) day period (“Mass Filing”), the parties shall select sixteen (16) individual arbitration demands (eight (8) per side) for arbitration to proceed (“Bellwether Arbitrations”). Only those sixteen (16) arbitration demands shall be filed with the arbitration provider, and the parties shall hold in abeyance, and not file, the non-Bellwether Arbitrations. Zoom will pay the arbitration provider’s costs for the sixteen (16) Bellwether Arbitrations. The statutes of limitation, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27.10 below, shall remain tolled when non-Bellwether arbitration demands are held in abeyance. While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, no other demand for arbitration that is part of the Mass Filing may be processed, administrated, or adjudicated, and no filing or other administrative costs for such a demand for arbitration shall be due from either party to the arbitration provider. If, contrary to this provision, a party prematurely files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance.\n",
    "\n",
    "All parties agree that arbitration demands are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint a sole standing administrative arbitrator (“Administrative Arbitrator”) to determine threshold questions such as (i) whether the Bellwether Arbitration process is applicable or enforceable, (ii) whether particular demand(s) are part of a Mass Filing, and (iii) whether demands within a Mass Filing were filed in accordance with this Agreement, including Section 27.3. In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s costs shall be paid by Zoom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days of its initial pre-hearing conference. The parties agree that the Bellwether Arbitration process is designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including the claims of individuals who are not selected for a Bellwether Arbitration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all remaining arbitration demands comprising the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”). The Global Mediation shall be administered by the arbitration provider administering the Bellwether Arbitrations. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within thirty (30) calendar days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be filed and administered by the arbitration provider on an individual basis pursuant to the arbitration provider’s rules, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint an Administrative Arbitrator to determine threshold questions regarding the newly filed demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parties agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the Bellwether Arbitration process, including the payment of filing and administrative costs for the Bellwether Arbitrations, deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Bellwether Arbitration Mass Filings until the Bellwether Arbitrations and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded, and cooperate on any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Bellwether Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, or mass action of any kind, or an arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision. The statutes of limitation applicable to each arbitration demand within a Mass Filing, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27.10 below, shall remain tolled from the time a party makes a Pre-Arbitration Demand to the time when that party files the arbitration demand with the arbitration provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.8 Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment. At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or Zoom may serve a written offer of judgment upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn, and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer (which, solely for purposes of offers of judgment, may include reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent they are recoverable by statute, in an amount not to exceed the damages awarded).\n",
    "\n",
    "The parties agree that any disputes with respect to settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment in a Mass Filing are to be resolved by a single arbitrator to the extent such offers contain the same material terms. For arbitrations involving represented parties, the represented parties’ attorneys agree to communicate individual settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment to each and every arbitration claimant or respondent to whom such offers are extended.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.9 Arbitration Costs. Except as provided for in a Mass Filing (see Section 27.7), your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative, and arbitrator costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules. If you have a gross monthly income of less than 300% of the federal poverty guidelines, you may be entitled to a waiver of certain arbitration costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.10 Requirement to File Within One Year. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, and notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, any claim or cause of action under this Agreement (with the exception of disputes under Section 27.2(2)) must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be permanently barred. The statute of limitations and any arbitration cost deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by Section 27.3 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.11 Opt-Out. You may reject this Arbitration Agreement and opt out of arbitration by sending an email to opt-out@zoom.us within (i) thirty (30) calendar days of April 1, 2023 if you are an existing user, or (ii) thirty (30) calendar days of the date you created your account if you are a new user. Your opt-out notice must be individualized and must be sent from the email address associated with your individual Zoom account. An opt-out notice that purports to opt out multiple parties will be invalid as to all such parties. No individual (or their agent or representative) may effectuate an opt out on behalf of other individuals. Your notice to opt-out must include your first and last name, address, the email address associated with your Zoom account, and an unequivocal statement that you decline this Arbitration Agreement. If you do decide to opt out, that opt out will apply to this Arbitration Agreement and all previous versions thereof, and neither party will have the right to compel the other to arbitrate any Dispute. However, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply to you, and opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may enter into in the future with us.\n",
    "\n",
    "27.12 Severability. Except as provided in Section 27.6 above, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to achieve the closest possible intent to the original intent of this section, inclusive of the severed provision.\n",

    "New to Google Cloud? A quick overview of Google Cloud’s online contracting can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are accessing the Google Cloud Platform Services as a customer of an unaffiliated Google Cloud Platform reseller, the terms below do not apply to you, and your agreement with your reseller governs your use of the Google Cloud Platform Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you signed an offline variant of this Agreement for use of the Google Cloud Platform services under the same Google Cloud Platform Account, the terms below do not apply to you, and your offline terms govern your use of the Google Cloud Platform Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "These Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service (together, the \"Agreement\") are entered into by Google and the entity or person agreeing to these terms (\"Customer\") and govern Customer's access to and use of the Services. \"Google\" has the meaning given at https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Agreement is effective when Customer clicks to accept it (the \"Effective Date\"). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provision of the Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Services Use. During the Term, Google will provide the Services in accordance with the Agreement, including the SLAs, and Customer may use the Services, and integrate the Services into any Customer Application that has material value independent of the Services, in accordance with the Agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Admin Console. Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may manage its use of the Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 Accounts. Customer must have an Account to use the Services and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account. Google has no obligation to provide multiple accounts to Customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 Modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) To the Services. Google may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to time. Google will inform Customer if Google makes a material change to the Services that has a material impact on Customer's use of the Services provided that Customer has subscribed with Google to be informed about such change.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) To the Agreement. Google may make changes to this Agreement (including the URL Terms) and pricing from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except to the extent the changes apply to new functionality or the Cloud Data Processing Addendum, or are required by applicable law, in which case they will be effective immediately. Google will provide at least 90 days' advance notice for materially adverse changes to any SLAs by (i) sending an email to the Notification Email Address; (ii) posting a notice in the Admin Console; or (iii) posting a notice to the applicable SLA webpage. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, Customer may stop using the Services. Customer may also terminate this Agreement for convenience under Section 8.4 (Termination for Convenience). Customer's continued use of the Services after such material change will constitute Customer's consent to such changes. Google will post any modification to this Agreement to https://cloud.google.com/terms/.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) To the Cloud Data Processing Addendum. Google may only change the Cloud Data Processing Addendum where such change is required to comply with applicable law, is expressly permitted by the Cloud Data Processing Addendum, or:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) is commercially reasonable;\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) does not result in a material reduction of the security of the Services;\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on Google's processing of \"Customer Personal Data,\" as described in the \"Scope of Processing\" Section of the Cloud Data Processing Addendum; and\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on Customer's rights under the Cloud Data Processing Addendum.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Google makes a material change to the Cloud Data Processing Addendum in accordance with this Section 1.4(c) (Modifications: To the Cloud Data Processing Addendum), Google will post the change at the webpage containing the Cloud Data Processing Addendum.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Discontinuation of Services. Google will notify Customer at least 12 months before discontinuing any Service (or associated material functionality) unless Google replaces such discontinued Service or functionality with a materially similar Service or functionality. Further, Google will notify Customer at least 12 months before significantly modifying a Customer-facing Google API in a backwards-incompatible manner. Nothing in this Section 1.4(d) (Discontinuation of Services) limits Google's ability to make changes required to comply with applicable law, address a material security risk, or avoid a substantial economic or material technical burden. This Section 1.4(d) (Discontinuation of Services) does not apply to pre-general availability Services, offerings, or functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5 Software. If Google makes Software available to Customer, including third-party software, Customer's use of any Software is subject to the applicable provisions in the Service Specific Terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Payment Terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Online Billing. At the end of the applicable Fee Accrual Period or as otherwise stated by Google in the Admin Console, Google will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges based on Customer's use of the Services during the applicable Fee Accrual Period (including, if applicable, the relevant Fees for TSS). If Google reasonably determines based on evidence available to Google that Customer is at risk of non-payment or that Customer’s Account is potentially fraudulent, then Google may invoice Customer more frequently. Customer will pay all Fees in the currency stated in the invoice. If Customer elects to pay by credit card, debit card, or other non-invoiced form of payment, Google will charge (and Customer will pay) all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period. If Customer elects to pay by invoice (and Google agrees), all Fees are due as stated in the invoice. Unless required by law, Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. Google's measurement of Customer's use of the Services is final. Google has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay any Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer and Customer will pay such Taxes to Google, unless Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate in respect of those Taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Customer will provide Google with any applicable tax identification information that Google may require under applicable law to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties, or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by Customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Payment Disputes & Refunds. Any payment disputes must be submitted in good faith before the payment due date. If Google, having reviewed the dispute in good faith, determines that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice, but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If a disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to a disputed invoice and Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. Refunds given by Google for billing inaccuracies under this Section will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4 Delinquent Payments; Suspension. Late payments (which, for clarity, do not include amounts subject to a good faith payment dispute submitted before the payment due date), may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Google in collecting such delinquent amounts. Further, in the event of any late payment for the Services, Google may Suspend the Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.5 No Purchase Order Number Required. Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Google to provide a purchase order number on Google's invoice (or otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Customer Obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 Compliance. Customer will (a) ensure that Customer and its End Users' use of the Services complies with the Agreement, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent and terminate any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, and (c) promptly notify Google of any unauthorized use of, or access to, the Services, Account, or Customer's password of which Customer becomes aware. Google reserves the right to investigate any potential violation of the AUP by Customer, which may include reviewing Customer Applications, Customer Data, or Projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Privacy. Customer is responsible for any consents and notices required to permit (a) Customer's use and receipt of the Services and (b) Google's accessing, storing, and processing of data provided by Customer (including Customer Data, if applicable) under the Agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 Restrictions. Customer will not, and will not allow End Users to, (a) copy, modify, or create a derivative work of the Services; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract any or all of the source code of, the Services (except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (c) sell, resell, sublicense, transfer, or distribute any or all of the Services; or (d) access or use the Services (i) for High Risk Activities; (ii) in violation of the AUP; (iii) in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees (including creating multiple Customer Applications, Accounts, or Projects to simulate or act as a single Customer Application, Account, or Project (respectively)) or to circumvent Service-specific usage limits or quotas; (iv) to engage in cryptocurrency mining without Google's prior written approval; (v) to operate or enable any telecommunications service or in connection with any Customer Application that allows End Users to place calls or to receive calls from any public switched telephone network, unless otherwise described in the Service Specific Terms; (vi) for materials or activities that are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the United States Department of State; (vii) in a manner that breaches, or causes the breach of, Export Control Laws; or (viii) to transmit, store, or process health information subject to United States HIPAA regulations except as permitted by an executed HIPAA BAA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4 Documentation. Google may provide Documentation for Customer's use of the Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.5 Copyright. Google responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates the Accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances as required to maintain safe harbor for online service providers under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 Third-Party Content Enforcement. If Customer’s primary use of the Services is to host third-party content or facilitate the sale of goods or services between third parties on its platform, Customer will take the following steps to enforce compliance with the AUP: (a) publish policies defining what content is prohibited on its platform (e.g., illegal content); (b) maintain a publicly accessible method (e.g., webform or email alias) to receive notices of violation of that policy (in addition to a monitored communications channel for Google); and (c) promptly review and address any such notices, and remove content where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Suspension.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 AUP Violations. If Google becomes aware that Customer's or any End User's use of the Services violates the AUP, Google will notify Customer and request that Customer correct the violation. If Customer fails to correct the violation within 24 hours of Google's request, then Google may Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services until the violation is corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Other Suspension. Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP Violations), Google may immediately Suspend all or part of Customer's use of the Services if (a) Google reasonably believes Suspension is needed to protect the Services, Google’s infrastructure supporting the Services, or any other customer of the Services (or their end users); (b) there is suspected unauthorized third-party access to the Services; (c) Google reasonably believes that immediate Suspension is required to comply with any applicable law; or (d) Customer is in breach of Section 3.3 (Restrictions) or the Service Specific Terms. Google will lift any such Suspension when the circumstances giving rise to the Suspension have been resolved. At Customer's request, Google will, unless prohibited by applicable law, notify Customer of the basis for the Suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Intellectual Property Rights; Protection of Customer Data; Feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.1 Intellectual Property Rights. Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, this Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other's content or any of the other's intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer retains all Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data and Customer Applications, and Google retains all Intellectual Property Rights in the Services and Software.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2 Protection of Customer Data. Google will only access, use, and otherwise process Customer Data in accordance with the Cloud Data Processing Addendum and will not access, use, or process Customer Data for any other purpose. Google has implemented and will maintain technical, organizational, and physical measures to protect Customer Data, as further described in the Cloud Data Processing Addendum.\n",

    "7.1 Obligations.

The recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to its Affiliates, employees, agents, or professional advisors (\"Delegates\") who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that its Delegates use the received Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement.\n",
    "\n",

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the recipient or its Affiliate may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal Process; provided that the recipient or its Affiliate uses commercially reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the other party before any such disclosure of its Confidential Information, and (b) comply with the other party's reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsections (a) and (b) above will not apply if the recipient determines that complying with (a) and (b) could (i) result in a violation of Legal Process; (ii) obstruct a governmental investigation; or (iii) lead to death or serious physical harm to an individual.\n",

    "We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things that you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:\n",
    "Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. So, we offer you different types of accounts and features to help you create, share, grow your presence and communicate with people on and off Instagram. We also want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram. Please see our recommender systems' system cards for information on how our various recommender systems prioritise signals to determine which content and suggestions to show you, as well as options for customising your experience. You can also review our Privacy Policy to learn more about how we personalise your Instagram experience.\n",
    "Promoting safety, integrity and security on and across the Meta Products.\n",
    "We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think that they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. Learn more about the restrictions that we may impose on the use of Instagram, including information on how we apply our content policies, procedures, measures and tools here. Learn more about how we deal with repeated violations of our content policies here; for example, our Misuse Policy sets out how we may suspend access to Instagram where we determine that you have frequently provided manifestly illegal content, or suspend processing reports and complaints where we determine that you have frequently submitted manifestly unfounded reports or complaints. We use all of the information that we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Privacy Policy.\n",
    "Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.\n",
    "Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service. Learn more in the Privacy Policy.\n",
    "Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products, outside of our contract with you.\n",
    "Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information, including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Privacy Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products depending on your choices.\n",

And we try to make that content as relevant as all of your other experiences on Instagram. For more information about how we use information to provide you with a personalised experience, please review our Privacy Policy.\n",

    "If you choose to subscribe to use Meta Products without ads, you won't see ads from us and we do not use your data for ads. The details of price, currency and payment period for the subscription for no ads will be provided to you before you complete your purchase.\n",
    "If we show you ads on Meta Products, we show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your information. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18 and 35 who live close to the advertiser's store in Portugal). We then show their ad to people who we think might find it relevant.\n",
    "We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.\n",
    "You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.\n",
    "You can learn about how we collect and use your information in our Privacy Policy, including more details on the different types of information that we can use to show you ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products).

    "\n",
    "The Privacy Policy\n",

We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a \"licence\") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Privacy Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.\n",

    "We can remove or restrict any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. Learn more about our Complaints Handling Process here. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process has begun. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. After the content has been deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.\n",
    "Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:\n",
    "where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content has been deleted); or\n",
    "where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or\n",
    "where deletion would restrict our ability to:\n",

    "comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or\n",
    "comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;\n",
    "in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).\n",
    "If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called \"Our agreement and what happens if we disagree\" will still apply even after your account has been terminated, disabled or deleted.\n",

If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If you have a subscription for no ads, then the No Ads Terms also apply. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.\n",
    "If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.\n",

    "Who is responsible if something happens.\n",
    "We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.\n",
    "The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.\n",
    "How we will handle disputes.\n",
    "If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.\n",

       " 2. **VII. Account Content:** This section holds you responsible for all content you post and gives Dreamwidth the right to remove content at their discretion.  You can be held liable for copyright violations, even if you're unaware of them.  🔴\n",

The broad license to reproduce your content, liability for copyright infringement, and lack of warranty and liability protection require careful consideration. \n",
       "\n",
       "It's crucial to weigh the benefits of using Dreamwidth against the potential risks involved. If you're comfortable with the terms and are confident in your ability to avoid copyright infringement, you may proceed with accepting the ToS.

    "Abusive Clauses and ToS Analysis:\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of some clauses that may be potentially harmful to you as a digital artist based on your provided information:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔴 1. Intellectual Property Rights (Section 5.1): This clause grants Google broad ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights generated through your use of the Services, including your Customer Data and Customer Applications. This means you may have limited control over how your own creative work is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟠 2. Indemnification (Section 13): This clause requires you to defend and indemnify Google against any third-party claims arising from your use of the Services, even if you are not at fault. This could expose you to significant financial risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟠 3. Suspension and Termination (Section 4): This clause allows Google to suspend or terminate your access to the Services without notice for various reasons, including violating the AUP or if Google believes it is necessary to protect its infrastructure. This lack of clarity and potential for arbitrary action could disrupt your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟠 4. Limitation of Liability (Section 12): This clause limits Google's liability for damages arising from the Services, including lost revenue or profits. This means you may have limited recourse if something goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "🟠 5. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution (Section 14.12): This clause requires any disputes to be resolved under Californian law and in Californian courts. This could be inconvenient and costly for you if you are located outside of California.\n",
    "\n",
    "ToS Overall Analysis:\n",
    "While the Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service offer some benefits, such as access to powerful tools and resources, the clauses mentioned above raise significant concerns for digital artists due to potential limitations on intellectual property ownership, financial risks, service disruptions, and limited legal recourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "⚠️ Difficult to say, read carefully the summary and decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the potential downsides, it is crucial to carefully weigh the benefits and risks before accepting these Terms of Service. You may want to consider consulting with a legal professional to fully understand the implications of these clauses and negotiate better terms if possible.\n",

      "This seemingly simple experiment, involving shining a beam of light through two closely spaced slits onto a screen, reveals a profound and counterintuitive aspect of quantum mechanics.\n",
